# TDEE-Calculator
Calculates TDEE

The aim of this program is to be able to take in user input and produce an estimate of the amount of calories burned in a day.
Those inputs include height, weight, age, and activity.
Those inputs are used in an equation to produce the BMR or basal metobolic rate (i.e. calories burned while not doing anything)
The BMR is then put into an equation called the Mifflin - St. Jeor equation to produce the TDEE (can google if unfimilar with both formulas)
